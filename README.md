# R2D
R2D is a high-performance 2D game engine, boiled down from its larger, more powerful, 3D originator, the R3D game engine. Built directly on top of Direct3D12,  the goal is to provide a lightweight API for rendering 2D graphics along with a few other utilities relevant to comparatively low-level game development.

## Usage
The repository contains a solution and project targeting Visual Studio 2019. After opening the solution/project and building it, you can find the resultant library files in the `Include` directory, which you can include to begin using the engine.
 
## Development
The project is still in its infancy stages and more will come soon!
